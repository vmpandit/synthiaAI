## 📚 How It Works

```

Synthia first analyzes your website, then asks 3-5 targeted questions to clarify:

- Brand voice preferences

### Phase 2: Content Generation
```
Upload Image → AI Vision Analysis → Apply Persona + Framework → 8 Content Pieces
```

For each content type, Synthia:
1. Analyzes the image in detail (objects, people, setting, mood)
2. Applies your brand persona
3. Uses the corresponding expert framework
4. Generates publication-ready content
5. Appends "How to Use" instructions

### Phase 3: AEO Audit (NEW)

```

Synthia audits your website's readiness for AI answer engines and provides:
- Schema markup implementation guides
- Content structure optimizations
